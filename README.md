md5-rfc-js
==========

This is a barebones MD5 implementation written in Javascript based directly off the pseudocode contained in RFC 1321.
It was written purely for entertainment sake to see how hard it was to do so. I have no particular attachment to this
code so I have licensed it under the MIT License. If you wish to use this code for some reason; enjoy.
